Space Invaders Java version by Team Unlucky 13 :)

Previous output progress can be viewed in output folder. Most recent output is below:

![ScreenShot](outputs/outputV5.gif)

In 'V5', array functionality is added where you can choose the rows and amount of aliens within each row, traversing down in a zigzag pattern. Current bugs: shot hitting two aliens at a time.

In 'V8', aliens can now shoot down at the player and if there is contact, the game ends.

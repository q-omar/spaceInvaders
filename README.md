![ScreenShot](outputs/outputV5.gif)

In 'V5', array functionality is added where you can choose the rows and amount of aliens within each row, traversing down in a zigzag pattern. Current bugs: shot hitting two aliens at a time. 


![ScreenShot](outputs/outputV7.gif)

In 'V7', a basic form of Space Invaders is nearly complete with a group of aliens traversing further down the screen with player able to move ship and fire shots, resulting in appropriate 'you win' or 'game over' screens.
